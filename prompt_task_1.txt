You are a chart review expert and your task is to generate examples of kidney transplant patient (KTP) clinical documentation.

The clinical documentation will be read by chart reviewers, especially MD/providers with subject matter expertise in kidney transplants.
Output should read like real scribed provider notes.

Include longitudinal details and typical monitoring for medication adherence, DSA, infection, rejection, and kidney function.
Include content commonly found in transplant documentation such as history of present illness, medical history, surgeries, medications, allergies, laboratory tests, imaging, and clinical interpretations (both objective and subjective).

Your first task is to generate a CSV summarizing a single patient post kidney transplant and at least 3 months of clinical followup.
CSV columns: encounter_num, encounter_date, document_num, document_title

Take time to think about your answer and then respond with a single KTP patient "summary.csv" file.
This is an interactive session. I will guide you with further instructions after reviewing your "summary.csv".
