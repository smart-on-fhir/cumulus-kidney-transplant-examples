Plan
- Borderline TCMR with new DSA. Start IV methylprednisolone 500 mg x3 days, then taper oral prednisone.
- Increase MMF to 1.25 g BID (as tolerated).
- Tacrolimus target trough adjusted upward to 9–11 ng/mL.
- Consider IVIG if DSA persists or MFI increases.
- Close monitoring: repeat creatinine and DSA in 4–6 weeks.
