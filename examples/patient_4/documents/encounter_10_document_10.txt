Service: Transplant Nephrology

Chief Complaint:
Routine post-transplant follow-up, monitoring for graft function, rejection, and infection.

Interval History:
Patient reports ongoing nausea interfering with medication adherence. Missed one tacrolimus dose in past week. Denies fever, chills, dysuria, or cough. Reports fatigue and mild hand tremors.

Objective:
Vital signs stable. Exam unremarkable except for mild tremor. 
Labs: Creatinine 1.9 mg/dL, tacrolimus trough 4.8 (low therapeutic range), WBC 6.1, hemoglobin 11.2. Urinalysis negative for infection. 
DSA screen pending. 
Patient continues on triple therapy immunosuppression plus prophylactic antimicrobials.

Assessment:
1. Kidney transplant recipient at high immunologic risk due to HLA mismatch.
2. Concern for nonadherence with immunosuppressive therapy.
3. Tacrolimus level subtherapeutic – risk of rejection and DSA formation.
4. At risk for infection – no current clinical signs.

Plan:
- Reinforce medication adherence, address nausea with ondansetron PRN
- Increase tacrolimus dose to target trough 6–8
- Repeat labs in 3–4 days
- Continue prophylaxis (TMP-SMX, valganciclovir)
- Monitor for DSA results and adjust therapy if positive.
