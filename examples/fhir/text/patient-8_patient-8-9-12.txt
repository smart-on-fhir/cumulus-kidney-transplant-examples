Immunosuppression Adjustment Addendum – MMF dose reduced for rising BK

Background:
Week 8 visit revealed BK viral load rising.

Plan:
Reduce MMF from 1 g BID → 750 mg BID.
Continue tacrolimus 3.5 mg BID, prednisone taper.
Repeat BK PCR in 2 weeks.
Monitor closely for evidence of rejection (DSA, creatinine trend).
Patient educated about rationale for lowering MMF: balancing infection vs rejection risk. Patient expressed understanding and agreement.
