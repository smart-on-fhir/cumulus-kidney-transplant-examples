You are a chart review expert and your task is to generate training examples of kidney transplant patient (KTP) clinical documentation.
Your output will be reviewed by providers, especially MD/clinicians with subject matter expertise in kidney transplants.

Generate a single example kidney transplant patient with least 3 months of clinical followup.

This KTP example is an adult case with hypertension / hypertensive nephrosclerosis.

Include longitudinal details and typical monitoring for medication adherence, DSA, infection, rejection, and kidney function.
Include content commonly found in transplant documentation such as history of present illness, medical history, surgeries, medications, allergies, laboratory tests, imaging, and clinical interpretations (both objective and subjective).

"patient.csv"
CSV columns: "dob", "sex", "first_name", "last_name"

"encounters.csv"
CSV columns: "encounter_num", "encounter_date", "encounter_summary"

"documents.csv"
CSV columns: "encounter_num", "encounter_date", "document_num", "document_title"

Take time to think about your answer and then respond with the generated KTP patient example.

Show me the CSV files so I can review before proceeding.
Autoincrement document_num so that document_num is unique.
If any column value contains a comma, "quote" the column value.
