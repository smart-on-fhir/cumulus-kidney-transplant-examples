Consult Note â€“ Transplant Nephrology
Date of Visit: 2025-06-17
Reason for Consult: Rising creatinine, concern for rejection.

History of Present Illness:
Patient is now 11 months post kidney transplant from an unrelated donor with poor HLA match. Presents with rising creatinine (2.8 mg/dL from baseline 1.7), new proteinuria, and intermittent adherence lapses to immunosuppression (missed doses of tacrolimus and MMF). Reports fatigue but no fever or infectious symptoms. 

Physical Exam:
BP 148/90, HR 84, afebrile. No graft tenderness. No edema. 

Labs:
Creatinine 2.8, BUN 40, tacrolimus trough 3.9, WBC 5.5, hemoglobin 10.8. Urinalysis: proteinuria, no pyuria. 
DSA screen positive for Class II antibodies. 
BK virus negative, CMV negative.

Assessment:
High risk for antibody-mediated rejection due to poor match and low tacrolimus troughs. Positive DSA concerning for developing ABMR.

Recommendations:
- Allograft biopsy to confirm rejection
- Initiate planning for plasmapheresis + IVIG if biopsy confirms ABMR
- Consider rituximab depending on biopsy severity
- Intensify patient education on strict adherence
- Monitor for opportunistic infections during augmented immunosuppression
