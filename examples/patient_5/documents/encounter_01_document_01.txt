Inpatient Hospitalization Note
Date of Admission: 2024-09-24
Service: Transplant Surgery / Nephrology Co-Management
Reason for Admission: Living donor kidney transplantation due to ESRD from hypertensive nephrosclerosis. Poor donor-recipient match with high HLA mismatch, elevated risk for DSA formation.

History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of CKD stage 5, hypertension, and anemia of chronic kidney disease. He presents today for scheduled kidney transplant. Donor is unrelated, HLA mismatch 5/6, PRA elevated pre-transplant (38%). Patient underwent induction immunosuppression with thymoglobulin and IV methylprednisolone. Perioperative antibiotics administered. Patient was transferred post-operatively to the surgical ICU for monitoring. 

Hospital Course (POD#0-2):
- POD#0: Extubated in OR, transferred to SICU, hemodynamically stable. Minimal urine output initially. Foley catheter in place. 
- POD#1: Urine output improving with lasix challenge. Creatinine decreased from 7.4 pre-op to 5.2. Electrolytes stable. Tacrolimus initiated. Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) continued. Steroid taper as per protocol. 
- POD#2: Improved urine output. Blood pressure controlled with labetalol. No fevers. CBC stable. Monitoring for infection (blood cultures, urinalysis) negative. Wound clean, dry, intact.

Past Medical History:
- Hypertension
- ESRD on hemodialysis (4 years)
- Secondary hyperparathyroidism
- Anemia of CKD
- Hyperlipidemia

Assessment:
Patient is recovering from living donor kidney transplant with higher immunologic risk due to poor donor-recipient match. At risk for early DSA formation and antibody-mediated rejection. No immediate postoperative complications. 

Plan:
- Continue immunosuppressive regimen: tacrolimus, MMF, prednisone taper
- Daily tacrolimus trough levels
- Strict monitoring for infection (CBC, cultures, CXR as indicated)
- Monitor graft function (serum creatinine, urine output, daily weights)
- DSA surveillance at 1, 3, 6, 12 months
- Discharge planning pending stability of graft function and tacrolimus troughs.
