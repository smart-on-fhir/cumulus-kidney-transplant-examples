Procedure: Deceased Donor Kidney Transplant – Left Lower Quadrant

Indications:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with ESRD secondary to diabetic nephropathy, on hemodialysis since 2022. He was deemed an appropriate candidate for kidney transplantation. A suitable deceased donor kidney became available.

Donor Information:
Donor: Deceased donor, 32-year-old male, cause of death: traumatic brain injury.
KDPI: 42%
Serologies: Negative for HIV, HBV, HCV
Crossmatch: Negative
HLA Mismatch: 4/6

Operative Details:
After induction of general anesthesia, the patient was placed supine. A left lower quadrant Gibson incision was made. The external iliac vessels were exposed. The donor kidney (right kidney, single artery, single vein, single ureter) was prepared on the back table. Preservation solution: University of Wisconsin.

Vascular anastomoses were performed end-to-side: donor renal vein to external iliac vein, donor renal artery to external iliac artery. Clamp time was 34 minutes. Upon reperfusion, the kidney immediately pinked up and produced urine on the table.

The ureter was implanted into the bladder using the Lich-Gregoir technique over a double-J stent. Hemostasis was achieved. Estimated blood loss: 150 mL. No intraoperative complications.

Implant Information:
- Donor right kidney
- Double-J ureteral stent (6 Fr, 12 cm)

Specimens:
None

Counts:
All counts correct

Disposition:
The patient tolerated the procedure well, was extubated in the operating room, and transferred to the PACU in stable condition with good urine output.
