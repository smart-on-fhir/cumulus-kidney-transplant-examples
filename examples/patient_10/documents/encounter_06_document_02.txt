Outside Labs – 2025-06-26

Summary:
Fax received from outside laboratory following patient’s visit to community nephrology clinic.

Results:
- Creatinine: 2.3 mg/dL (stable compared to prior).  
- Tacrolimus trough: 6.8 ng/mL (below goal).  
- CBC: WBC 7.2, Hb 11.0, Plt 225.  
- LFTs normal.  

Interpretation:
Allograft function stable. Tacrolimus trough below target range (goal 8–10). Concern for inconsistent dosing or delayed lab draw relative to medication timing.

Plan:
Contact patient to verify medication adherence and timing of labs. Consider slight dose increase if repeat trough remains low. Communicate results to transplant nephrology team.
