DSA Monitoring Panel â€“ 2025-08-05

Summary:
HLA antibody testing performed in the setting of recent adherence issues.

Results:
- Class I: Negative.  
- Class II: New low-level donor-specific antibodies detected (DQ7, MFI ~2000).  

Interpretation:
Development of new Class II DSAs, low-level. Indicates possible early sensitization, potentially related to variable immunosuppression adherence. Requires close follow-up.

Plan:
- Intensify immunosuppressive regimen.  
- Schedule allograft biopsy if creatinine rises further.  
- Repeat DSA in 2 weeks.
