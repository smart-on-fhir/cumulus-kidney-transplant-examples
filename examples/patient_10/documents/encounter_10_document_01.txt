Outside Lab-Only Encounter – 2025-08-19

Summary:
Patient obtained labs at Quest Diagnostics per transplant center request. Results faxed to clinic.

Results:
- Creatinine: 2.6 mg/dL (slightly higher than baseline).  
- Tacrolimus trough: 5.9 ng/mL (subtherapeutic; goal 8–10).  
- CBC: WBC 6.5, Hb 11.3, Plt 210.  
- LFTs normal.  

Interpretation:
Rising creatinine with subtherapeutic tacrolimus level raises concern for possible under-immunosuppression and alloimmune activity. Pattern consistent with adherence concerns noted previously.

Plan:
Transplant nephrology to contact patient for review of timing and dosing. Consider biopsy if renal function continues to worsen. Repeat labs in 1 week.
