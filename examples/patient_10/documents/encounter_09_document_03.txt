Immunosuppression Adjustment Plan – 2025-08-05

Summary:
Based on DSA results and tacrolimus trough variability, plan to optimize immunosuppression.

Changes:
- Increase tacrolimus to 3mg AM / 2mg PM, goal trough 8–10 ng/mL.  
- Reinforce adherence with use of alarms and daily pillbox checks.  
- Resume MMF at full dose 1g BID (patient had intermittently reduced dose due to GI upset).  
- Continue prednisone 20mg daily.  

Monitoring:
- Weekly labs (BMP, CBC, tacrolimus trough).  
- Repeat DSA panel in 2 weeks.  
- Patient and wife counseled extensively on risks of nonadherence and importance of maintaining therapeutic levels.
