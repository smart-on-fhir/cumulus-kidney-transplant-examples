Assessment/Plan:
Month 3 visit with stable graft function but rising BK viral load. MMF dose reduced by 25% to limit immunosuppression burden. Continue tacrolimus and prednisone. Repeat BK PCR in 2 weeks. Monitor closely for signs of rejection given reduced MMF. Reinforce infection precautions and adherence. RTC in 4 weeks with labs and PCRs.
