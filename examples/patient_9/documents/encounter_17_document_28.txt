Encounter 17, Document 28
Title: Lab-Only Visit — Creatinine 1.9 mg/dL; CMV PCR 1,200 IU/mL; WBC 2.3 (leukopenia)

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
This is a kidney transplant patient who presents for lab-only visit — creatinine 1.9 mg/dl; cmv pcr 1,200 iu/ml; wbc 2.3 (leukopenia). The patient continues under close monitoring following deceased donor kidney transplant. Clinical course has been complicated by inflammation that is difficult to treat, in part due to infectious risk. Today, interval history was reviewed with attention to medication adherence, kidney function, infection surveillance, and donor-specific antibody testing.

PAST MEDICAL AND SURGICAL HISTORY:
History of end-stage renal disease, hypertension, and anemia of chronic kidney disease. Status post renal transplant surgery. No interval surgical complications reported aside from expected post-transplant inflammation.

MEDICATIONS:
Patient remains on tacrolimus-based immunosuppression with adjunctive therapy adjusted as needed due to complications. Valganciclovir or other antimicrobials have been used during infectious complications. Steroid use has been minimized due to concurrent CMV activity.

ALLERGIES:
No known drug allergies documented.

LABORATORY AND IMAGING RESULTS:
Recent labs reviewed, including serum creatinine, tacrolimus trough levels, CBC, and CMV PCR when applicable. Imaging such as renal transplant Doppler ultrasound performed as indicated.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
The patient continues to require close follow-up. Inflammation and immune activity are being balanced with infectious risk. Medication adherence was reinforced. Further monitoring with labs, DSA surveillance, and biopsy/imaging as indicated will guide next steps. The patient and family were counseled on signs of rejection, infection, and when to contact the transplant team.
