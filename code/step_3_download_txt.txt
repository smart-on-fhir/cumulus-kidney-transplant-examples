Generate realistic, real-world, EHR clinical text for each document in "documents.csv".

Output each document to a txt file using the naming convention: encounter_num-document_num.txt
Each txt file will be named like this:
encounter-1_document-1.txt
encounter-1_document-2.txt
encounter-2_document-3.txt
encounter-num_document-num.txt

If necessary, use stepwise generation to generate batches of txt files in ZIP files.
