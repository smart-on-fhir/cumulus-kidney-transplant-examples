Generate realistic, real-world, EHR clinical text for each document in "documents.csv".

Output each document to a txt file using the naming convention: encounter_num-document_num.txt
Each txt file will be named like this:
encounter_1-document_1.txt
encounter_1-document_2.txt
encounter_2-document_3.txt
encounter_num-document_num.txt

If necessary, use stepwise generation to generate batches of txt files in ZIP files.
